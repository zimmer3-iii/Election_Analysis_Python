 6. The voter turnout for each county.
 7. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
 8. The county with the highest turnout.

## Summary
A few notes about the python script used for this analysis:
- This script can be used for any election result with at least 1 candidate and 1 county.
- This script must be udpated if the election data is not stored in a folder called "Resources" and/or the script is not
run from a folder containing the "Resources" folder.
- Similarly the script will not print the results to a text file if there is not a folder called "analysis".
- An improvement that could be made is to have the results display the numbers of votes and percentage of votes
 each candidate got from each county.
